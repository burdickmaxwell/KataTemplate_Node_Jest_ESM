# Code Kata

A kata is a way to practice fundamental elements of a craft in isolated, repeatable ways.  The aim of katas is to improve mastery of a craft with over time, making tiny improvements with each iteration.  Over time, these katas can build on eachother and concentration can be placed at a broader scope, with knowledge that any element need has been habitualy ingraned and will be masterfully performed at any time.

Since software does not have at its root an element of physical control, we can not rely on muscle memory to guide us through execution of new tasks.  Instead, the habits mastered will be how we craft our software, how we disassemble tasks into small working elements--in essence, how we solve problems. By using constraints, we can unlock further challenges, so the repitition of a kata does not become an exercise of writing steps from memory, but instead strengthens creativity and understanding of the craft of software development.
